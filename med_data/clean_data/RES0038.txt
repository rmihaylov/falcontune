D: OK, and so exercise makes it worse. Anything that you do that helps you relieve the cough?

P: Uhm, nope, that was it.

D: OK, so based on what we talked about, it seems that based on your past history and the coughing that you're having right now, one of the things that we definitely want to look at is if you do in fact have asthma. Um, it can also be like viral upper respiratory tract infection, but we will do some pulmonary function tests for you and see if the bronchodilators just like you use the inhaler from your son if that helps helps you with your symptoms and then we can go from there.

P: That sounds great. Thank you.

D: You're welcome. Well, take care.
