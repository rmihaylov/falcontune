D: Alright, and do you smoke at all or did you smoke in the past?

P: Yeah, I I, I do smoke but I've cut down significantly in the past few years. I currently only smoke, uh, probably two or three cigarettes a day. I was, I was smoking like almost a pack a day a few years back.

D: Oh, that's great. It's great that you're trying to cut down. Do you intend on getting the getting down the smoking even further?

P: Yeah, that's that's the plan. If I can do that, hopefully by the end of this year, that would be great.

D: That's wonderful. Do you smoke marijuana at all?

P: No. 

D: Uh, do you smoke any recreational drugs?

P: No. 

D: Any alcohol?

P: Alcohol, just, uh, probably just on the weekends or have a couple of beers.

D: OK alright, uhm. So, I guess from the symptoms that you've described, it sounds like you likely have a condition called acute rhinosinusitis where you have inflammation of the sinuses in your face and potentially some inflammation in your nose as well, and often it's caused by a virus and it usually gets better in a couple of weeks. And the best thing to do is just conservative management. Try to rest and, if, if you know taking any medications, over the counter medications is helping you feel better, if you feel like Tylenol, sort of reducing some of that pressure or if doing a, taking a steam bath is sort of helping relieve that pressure, try those. Drink a lot of water to try to sort of lear out all that mucus that's that's building up. I'll also do a physical exam and talk to my attending and confirm all this information with him and we can go from there.

P: Great sounds good, thank you.

D: Uhm, also sorry before for in the call because the symptoms are started recently and they do uhm, overlap with some of the symptoms that if patient with COVID might have, it might be a good idea to get a COVID swab done as well, so we'll do that today and you would have to quarantine and stay away from the people at your home as well, until the results are out, and then if it's positive, public health will let you know what to do.

P: Alright, sounds good. Thank you so much.

D: Welcome.
