P: Just a student.

D: OK. And currently do you smoke?

P: Uhm, I'mm smoke maybe maybe socially so, maybe a pack of cigarettes a week at the at the most.

D: OK. And any recreational drug use like marijuana?

P: Uh, yeah I'll smoke one or two joints on on the weekend with friends socially.

D: OK yeah, so yeah. This uh, the smoking marijuana or cigarettes make your symptoms worse at all?

P: Uhm, it depends. Yeah, sometimes I can. It can bring on some more coughing.

D: Yeah, so yeah, we always recommend cutting down or quitting smoking whenever, whenever we see patients who are smoking, especially like, you're fairly young. And you know your grandfather had history of lung cancer with smoking throughout the year. So as early as we can quit smoking, the better for the long term health of your lungs, but whenever you're thinking of quitting, or if you want any more resources about quitting, just let me know. We can set up a separate appointment for that.

P: OK, that that sounds good. Yeah, maybe maybe next appointment we can talk about that.

D: OK, sounds good. Um. Any, uh, so no recreational, so just besides marijuana. Any other recreational drugs like cocaine or crystal meth, anything of that sort?

P: Ah, no. Well, sometimes I at parties maybe a few times a year with friends will use ecstasy or something like that, but that's only a few times a year.

D: OK. Uh, and any alcohol?

P: Yeah, I'll have a few drinks on the weekend with with friends usually. Like rum or beer.

D: OK. Yeah, so this is all the questions I had for you today. Any, any questions or concerns or any ideas of what you think this might be?

P: Uhm, I don't know. I'm really concerned about the the blood that I brought up like I mean is this cancer or, uh, uh tuberculosis like one of those tuberculosis infections that I heard about while I was away?

D: Yeah, so definitely, a cancer is pretty unlikely because you're fairly young and you've just recently started smoking, but one of the things that we're concerned about is your recent travel history being in close quarters. So definitely we need to get a chest X-Ray and we can even do a sputum culture to test for tuberculosis. And then based on the results, we might have to start you on like a whole antibiotic regiment if it does come back as tuberculosis. Yeah, we'll, we'll, we'll get those investigations done first and then we'll go from there.

P: OK, thank you.

D: We'll also get some blood work done as well, so that'll be done before your next appointment.

P: Alright, that sounds good. Thank you. 

D: You're welcome.
