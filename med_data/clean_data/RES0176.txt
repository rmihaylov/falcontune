D: Yeah, for sure. Umm, certainly would be frightening. OK, and do you use the inhaler everyday?

P: Hum, no.

D: Alright, so we will do some pulmonary function testing and get some imaging of your lungs today as well as an ECG and maybe a monitor for your heart as well to just check your heart racing for the next 48 hours. Mentioning that your heart was racing and so to rule out that any abnormal rhythms of your heart, or to check for that. And we will kind of go from there, did you have any questions? 

P: No.
