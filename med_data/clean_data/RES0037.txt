D: I would just like to start with what brought you in here today to the family clinic?

P: Yeah, so I've been coughing for a few months now and so that's the problem.

D: OK, and how many months have you been coughing for?

P: Just over two, I would say, and it's been I've been bringing up this yellow, greenish sputum. It's kind of gross.

D: OK, and how, how much of the sputum would you say you're bringing up in an average day? Like a teaspoon? Tablespoon?

P: : Oh I see OK. I don't know, maybe a few teaspoons throughout the day.

D: OK.

P: At first I thought I I I had a, a chest infection, but even after antibiotics from my GP, or or my family doctor, It never cleared up. 

D: OK, and so when did you go on the antibiotics?

P: Ah so this is about, uh, about a month ago. 

D: Mhmm.

P: And yeah, so I went to see my family doctor about the cough then and dad was prescribed some antibiotics. I think azithromycin and it, it still didn't, it didn't do anything. 

D: OK, I see. And do you find that your cough has been getting worse since then?

P: Uh, I would say the cough has been about the same.

D: OK. But how about the sputum that you're bringing up, has that increased? 

P: Uh, it's about the same, but it definitely I would say there's a pink tinge in the sputum now. Every once in awhile I've noticed more than than before.

D: OK. And did this all start after the chest infection or did you have something like this occur before?

P: Um, yeah, this all started after.

D: OK, I see. Was there anything that happened around that time? Any new environment that you were exposed to?
