D: OK, and how about any autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or hypothyroidism?

P: Nope.

D: OK, and as anybody in the family had a Dupuytren's contracture before?

P: Uhm no, I haven't I haven't heard it now.

D: OK, and so uh next, I just wanted to go on to the physical exam portion, so just a couple more questions. So when you're looking at your hand, are you seeing any swelling redness?

P: Not swelling, I just yeah just those nodules and I get like a little bit of whiteness around those nodules when I extend my fingers.

D: OK yeah, but no redness?

P: No.

D: OK, and are you are you seeing any, uh like muscle atrophy or any deformities of any of your joints in the fingers or the wrist?

P: Nope.

D: OK, and uh are there any areas that that you can palpate over your hand that causes pain.

P: Yeah, there's just some discomfort, like when I at the bases of those two fingers, like if I press on the nodules like it's sometimes a little bit like uncomfortable but it's not too bad. Like I, I don't, but I don't know I have a pretty high pain threshold too, so it's hard to say.

D: OK, I see an when you're extending your fingers with like passive extension to do with your other hand do you get a lot of pain like along the tendons or the passive extension?

P: Yeah definitely. I would say more painful than if I try to extend it myself. Like just forcing it back but yeah, but not not anything too like I like it's not sharp or anything like that.

D: OK, and with the on the nodules and stuff, do you feel any like crepitations or like crackling or rubbing over those, those areas or your palm?

P: Uhm crackling oh no not that I have noticed.

D: OK, and any issues with your like wrist or or elbow?

P: No, not that I know of.

D: OK. Uhm so I think that's everything that I wanted to ask about today. Did you have anything that you wanted to add or or did you have any questions?

P: No, I think that's all.

D: OK, I'm so right now it's sounding like it's most likely something called Dupuytren's contracture, but also we can't rule out like flexor tenosynovitis just yet or or trigger finger. Based on the the symptoms, but the fact that you're not having a fever, you don't have pain kind of along the the tendon, you're not seeing any swelling or redness that's all pointing away from the tenosynovitis.

P: Mmmm

D: But it'll be important to get some blood work and things to make sure that we're not missing that. But for Dupuytren's contracture. It'll be a uh, do doing what we can with therapy to try it like physiotherapy and activity modification to try and loosen those structures on the on the palm of your hand.

P: OK, sounds good.
