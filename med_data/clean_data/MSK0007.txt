D: OK, um and so next I wanted to walk through a physical exam, so when you look at the elbow yourself, do you see any swelling or redness?

P: No.

D: OK, does it look like there is any muscle atrophy either in the forearm or the biceps or triceps?

P: No.

D: OK, and how about any misalignment or joint deformity?

P: No, I don't see any of that.

D: OK, and are there any scars?

P: No.

D: OK, and when you press on the medial part of the the elbow, do you feel pain?

P: I do. 

D: How about over the olecranon or the, yea any pain over the olecranon? 

P: Um a little bit.

D: OK, and is there any pain over the lateral part of the elbow? 

P: No.

D: OK, an any pain over the forearm, or biceps, or triceps muscles?

P: No.

D: OK, and does the joint feel like it's hot?

P: No.

D: OK, and any pain with shoulder or elbow movements?

P: No. 

D: OK.

P: Actually, sorry with the elbow when I straighten it out all the way it hurts a little bit.

D: OK, when are you straightening it out all the way OK, But no pain with shoulder movements and full range of motion?

P: No, no pain with shoulder.

D: OK. And how about pain with pronation and supination?

P: With pronation it hurts.

D: OK, at the medial side? 

P: Yes.

D: OK and how about with wrist. So with resisted uh, yeah, wrist flexion?

P: Wrist flexion yeah. That hurts too.

D: OK, and then how about if you passively extend your your wrist as far down as as you can go?

P: Down uh yes. That hurts too. 

D: OK. And is there any numbness or tingling anywhere?

P: No, no, no numbness or tingling. 

D: OK. OK, so that was everything that I wanted to ask about today. Was there anything else that you wanted to mention?

P: No, that was that. What do you think I have and how can I fix it?

D: Yeah, so it. It's certainly it it sounds like with the medial aspect of your elbow having pain there over the last several months and some of the physical exam maneuvers, such as like passive wrist extension, resisted wrist flexion as well as pronation and the point tenderness over the medial elbow this could be a medial epicondylitis or a tendinopathy in that area. And so this is typically treated with activity modification, so this could be trying to avoid repetitive movements that that cause pain. And using medications such as Advil and Tylenol and doing strengthening and stretching exercises, which you can learn from a physiotherapist or or on your own as well. And also other things that that the medial side of the elbow that it could be is an ulnar ligament injury. Um or yeah, or the other thing to be considering is and ulnar ligament injury and so if the pain isn't going away, then we might consider an ultrasound or something to look at the structures there.

P: OK, that sounds great. Thank you.
