P: No. 

D: OK, and. What movement would you say hurts the most?

P: I I. Probably just moving the the wrist like flexing and extending the wrist

D: OK and where the swelling you said is at the base of the thumb, right?

P: Yeah, exactly at the base of the thumb on the on the back of the hand there are some bad bruising and swelling there.

D: OK is it warm at all to touch?

P: No, it doesn't feel warm.

D: OK, OK, and if you press on are you getting any bony pain in that area, like if you press on a bone?

P: Yeah, like, I mean, if I there's one spot that if I press down on it, it's like 10 of the 10 pain. It hurts really bad if I press at the base of my thumb there.

D:  OK, alright, so those are all the questions I had for you today. We definitely need to, since you're having pain on, just tell palpate palpating the area, there swelling redness, and you did have a fall and you landed on your you caught yourself with your hand. There is a common fracture that can happen in those circumstances to your wrist. And so we need to do an X-Ray and we will see if you have a fracture or not. But we also need to see if we need to get a cast for you or if if we can manage your injury with a splint or. And then based on what we see and if your physical examination we will determine how long you need to be in a cast or splint, and then we'll go from there.

P: OK, that sounds good, thank you.
