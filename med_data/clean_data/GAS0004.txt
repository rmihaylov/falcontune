D: I understand that you've been having some diarrhea. Can you tell me a little bit about that?

P: Yeah, sure I had, I've been having diarrhea for the past three to four days, and it's been pretty bad. I couldn't go, uh I couldn't go to my classes, had to skip because it was just it was just embarrassing.

D: OK, I'm sorry to hear that. Uh, have you ever experienced something like this before? 

P: Um, have I experienced something like this before? Uhm no, I don't think so.

D: OK. And over the three or four days, have your stools all been loose? Or have you had some solid ones in between?

P: I think they've mostly been loose. I think they've all been loose actually, if I think about it.

D: OK, and how many times a day have you been having episodes of diarrhea?

P: Oh my god, I have I've lost count. I'm going every every hour.

D: OK, every hour. OK, and then you notice any changes in the color of your stool?

P: No, it's brown.

D: OK. Any blood in your stool that you've noticed?

P: Um not really. I don't think so. I don't look that much to be honest.

D: OK, um have you noticed any any pain associated with it?

P: Well, I didn't start off with pain, but I I I do have a bit of a cramp now since yesterday. It's just it hurts. Yeah, it hurts sometimes, it comes and goes.

D: OK, and do you feel that when it, do you feel that you still have control over like releasing it to like does it come on and you don't even notice that it has happened or you still are able to kind of have a warning before you get to the toilet?

P: Uh no I do get a warning, but it's just I I do need to get to the toilet really fast, yeah.

D: OK, and before this happened, have you noticed, have you, is there anything that you've done differently that you've been eating differently, or any other changes that have happened in your life recently?

P: Um, I I did go to um, I did go to a new restaurant 5 days ago.

D: OK, what did you have there?

P: Um  I I just got some rice with chicken Manchurian, it was a nice little Chinese restaurant, and yeah.

D: Did anyone else have the same thing that you did that you were with?

P: Um, no not really, I went with my friend and I haven't really, haven't talked to her about this. I never really thought that these were related, that this was related to that.

D: And then it's, you know, absolutely, potentially not like, maybe not. It could possibly be so not to not to worry you about that. We just like to get an idea of kind of the whole picture of what you're coming in with. So in terms of the last three to four days, have you experienced any nausea or vomiting?

P: Yeah yeah, I have actually, but it's not been as bad as the diarrhea. I didn't even yeah, I didn't, I wasn't even thinking about that. Yeah, I I did vomit, I think twice yesterday.

D: And are you nauseated all the time, or is it kind of on and off? 

P: It's on and off.

D: OK, have you taken any any over the counter medicine or anything to help?
