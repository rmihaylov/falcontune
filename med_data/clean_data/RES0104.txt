D: OK. Alright, and have you thought of quitting at all? I know you've been smoking like for a very long time, but have you at all tried to quit before?

P: Like I've considered it, but I I just don't think it, it'll be possible at this time.

D: OK, well if you at all are wanting any information or want to talk about quitting at all, um, we can provide more resources. Do you besides smoking, do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana?

P: No.

D: No. Any alcohol at all?

P: No.

D: OK. Yeah, so those are some of the questions I had a, I will be doing a physical examination with your shortness of breath. I just want to get a good listen to your lungs and take all your vitals as well. However, yeah so after that since you're having some symptoms of what might be a pneumonia, it can be a bacterial infection, a viral infection, we will have to get some blood work done as well as a chest x-ray. And right now, with the pandemic going on, we will also do Covid swab test for you as well, just in case. Does that sound good?

P: Yeah, that makes sense, thank you.

D: Alright and, if if you're while you're here, if your shortness of breath gets any worse at all, just let us know and we'll help you out.

P: OK, thank you, will do.

D: Thank you, bye.

P: Bye.
