D: Have you been around a cat recently?

P: No, we used to have a cat, but unfortunately we were unable to keep it because allergies were so bad.

D: Yeah, do you have any environmental allergies at all? 

P: Uhm, yeah sometimes in the spring or fall I can get like itchy eyes and a runny nose, so that's why I didn't think much about the runny nose at first, but with a sore throat and, been sneezing more, I thought to come in. 

D: Yeah, OK. So in terms of your, uh, so general information. Do you live alone or do you live with your parents or anyone else?

P: Yeah, I live with my mom, dad and a younger brother.

D: Alright, and are you currently working or going to school?

P: Yeah, I'm finishing up Grade 8 and we're doing the courses online.

P: No, I haven't.

D: Have you taken any antibiotics recently?

P: No. 

D: OK, alright well it sounds like you're probably having just a common cold, likely viral. So, and seeing that it's only been two days, have your symptoms gotten better or worse in the past couple of days?

P: They've gotten worse since it's started.

D: Yeah, OK, well, it's only been two days so far, let's just keep an eye on your symptoms and see how you're doing. It might also be a good idea just to get a covid swab done, and if your symptoms continue to worsen, give me a call again and we can talk about it a little bit more and see if maybe a bacterial infection or if there's something else that's going on. You don't have any difficulties breathing, do you?

P: No, I don't.

D: Alright, OK, alright umm, we'll do a physical exam and then chat a little bit more after.

P: OK, thank you.
