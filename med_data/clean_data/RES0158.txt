D: OK, yeah, so that's definitely uh with you working in the in the hospital clinical setting, um there is definitely a possibility, and a lot of the symptoms that you're having overlap with Covid symptoms. Uh, so we will definitely get a Covid swab test done for you today. It usually comes back in the next 24 to 48 hours and until then uh I would recommend that you isolate either in a room separately, wear a mask around your family members, um isolate to the best of your abilities, not go outside, see if someone else can get groceries for you guys uh as well. And then um depending on the test, public health will contact you with further instructions.

P: OK, yeah, that sounds good. Thank you.

P: Take care.
