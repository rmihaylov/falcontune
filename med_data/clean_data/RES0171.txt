D: When did this start?

P: This started yesterday.

D: How bad is your shortness of breath?

P: Like, I don't know. I feel like I'm OK, like n terms of being able to breathe, but I mean if I exert myself at all, there's no way I would be able to. It's, I just feel like even at rest it's hard to breathe.

D: OK, has it gotten worse since yesterday or better, or kind of been the same?

P: It's mostly been that been the same or actually sorry it's got, got a little bit worse at first. It was more more with exertion, and now it's, at rest as well. So yeah, it's got worse. 

D: I see, OK. Are you able to talk in full sentences or do you need to take a deep like stop to take a breath?

P: I could talk in full sentences. 

D: And the chest pain, does it only occur when you take a deep breath, or are there other times as well?

P: I pretty much yeah only when I'm taking a deep breath and say, I mean, maybe that's why part of the I can't take a deep breath so it's making me feel it's making the breathing more difficult making me feel more short of breath.

D: OK OK uhm. You haven't ever had one, have you?

P: No, I I haven't had anything like that. 

D: OK, alright. So. I guess come to in terms of smoking, you said that you've tried to quit a couple of times in the past. Do you intend on trying again? I know it can be very hard to, to quit smoking.

P: Yeah, it's only something that is always kind of in the back of my mind.

D: OK, if there's I'm happy to assist you and share resources and problems like medications and things like that that could help you if you're interested so we can talk more about that. talking about your I guess you mentioned that your weight is a little higher than or, its outside the normal range, is that something that you would like to cut down?

P: Yeah, I really try to eat more vegetables and have been trying to do that sort of thing. I've lost a few pounds, but not enough, definitely want to keep going.

D: OK, good good, as long as you feel that you what you're currently doing is helping you and is helping you reduce weight. That's great. But also I'm here for you if you need more education or guidance on that. So, given what you've told me so far, it sounds like you might have developed a clot in your leg somewhere, simply because you had a surgery and you were not moving around very much. Sometimes that causes the blood to kind of, not move around your body is as as much as it usually does, and kind of stays in one place and get turned into a clot and that clot can sometimes get dislodged and settle into your lungs, and that can make it difficult for you to breathe. So, we'll do some tests that that's what my understanding is. Given what you've told me so far, but we do have to confirm it using a test. Also, the fact that you smoke and your weight, and your BMI is high, increases your risk of developing a clot, so I would definitely strongly recommend that you continue to try to reduce both and try to quit smoking. And so we'll do an ultrasound of your leg and we'll do a scan of your chest and see what's going on and then decide if we need to give you any medications, like any blood thinning medications.

P: OK, yeah, that sounds really good. Thank you.

D: Welcome.
