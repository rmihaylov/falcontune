I had to miss work, Just a headache started at the beginning and then I noticed the same day, so this was two days ago. A headache started and my body just started aching throughout the day and yesterday I just developed, I think it was a fever, I didn't really get a chance to check, like, but I was very chilly yesterday and now I have this cough as well.

D: OK, so just to confirm, so the, the symptoms at first started with a headache and, and fatigue, and that started two days ago?

D: OK, have you had any nausea and vomiting associated with that, the headache or anything else?

P: Uh, no.

D: OK. And so, and then, last question for the headache piece. Does it feel like it was a like kind of sudden onset, worst headache of your life sensation?

D: OK, no, that's great. And that reminds me, actually, how has your weight been over the last several months? Have you had any weight changes?

P: Not really, like I, I, I think over the last two years I've just been very focused on my fitness, so I feel like I've probably lost around 30 pounds over the last year. Last one to two, yeah, year, but like I, I've been exercising a lot like uhm, gym every day, it's, it's been, it's been a journey. 

D: no that's great though, good for you. I encourage you to keep that up for sure. OK, and so do you take any other medications, other, over the counter or prescribed?

P: No, nothing like that. 

D: OK, and right now, so you mentioned your son and wife, is that who you're living with?

P: Yeah, it's just us three. 

D: OK, and uh, any exposures to, to anybody who's been sick, either at home or at work or, or any other activities?

P:  Uh, unfortunately I do have to, uh, I'm one of the unlucky ones that still has to go into work. And yeah, it's it's hard to say like at work, there are times when we, like at lunch we eat like without a mask. I don't know if, I didn't notice anyone having any symptoms, but like, I don't know if someone, you know, who knows where anyone has been.

D: Yeah, so nobody that you're aware of who's been sick though?

P: No.

D: And everybody at home has been OK?

P: Yeah, at home everyone's good. I kind of just distance myself into like one room.

D: Mhm.

P: Just in case anything goes wrong.

D: OK. And have you traveled anywhere?

P: No, we've been, we've been at home this whole time.

D: OK. And do you smoke cigarettes?

P: No, I've never smoked.

D: OK, so do you, do you smoke marijuana?

P: No.

D: Alright and you use any other recreational drugs like cocaine, opioids, heroin? And how, have you used anything like that in the past?

P: No. Never.

D: OK, uhm, and do you drink alcohol?

P: Yeah, well just occasionally, like I would say maybe, maybe some wine, once, uh, like once every couple days. Maybe a beer on the weekend, but that's it. 

D: Alright. So I think that was all I wanted to ask on history today. Was there anything else that, that you wanted to add before we go on to the exam and?

P: Yeah, so I, I, I don't know if I should get a test done, like for covid. Uhm yeah, that's all, just wondering if I, if I can do that here?

D: Yeah, so that is something that that is on the differential for what could be causing your symptoms, especially with uhm, starting at having a cough and the nonspecific viral type symptoms with the cough, headache, muscle aches, so certainly could be caused by covid, but there are other reasons for, that could explain these symptoms, such as other types of viral illnesses, and so we will do a PCR swab today, as well as do, well, check your vitals to see if you have a fever now and we'll also maybe send an influenza swab as well, and and do some blood work. But in the meantime, since we're running the covid swab, it will be important to self isolate for the next 14 days and we will let you know what the test results show. But despite, even if they are negative, it will be important to still stay self isolating for the next 14 days.

P: OK, I'll do that. That sounds good.

D: Alright, thank you.
