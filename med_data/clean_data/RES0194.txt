P: Yeah, I was just worried that it could be covid with how everything's going on, and that's just sort of what I was wondering about today. 

D: Yeah, so that's something we definitely want to rule out. Your symptoms definitely overlap with the cluster of symptoms that someone may get with covid, so we will do a swab on you today and recommend that you isolate for two weeks until your symptoms have gone and the test result you will get you will get back in the next 24 to 48 hours. And alongside your test results. So you will also get further instructions from public health about whether or not you need another swab later on and when to return to work.

P: OK that yeah, that sounds good. Thank you.

D: Yeah no worries and it can definitely also be another viral infection as well, even if it's not covid, in which case it just you just need to get some rest stay hydrated and let it take its course.

P: OK, now that sounds that sounds good, so it could be covid or like another viral illness. 

D: Yeah, 

P: OK, thank you.

D: Welcome, take, care, take care.


Hey.
