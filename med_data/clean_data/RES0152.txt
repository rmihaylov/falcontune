And you've also been really um fatigued and have had some malaise over the last several weeks. Um and any other symptoms or, oh and also yeah, you've had some night sweats, chills, and uh been feeling feverish as well, so we'll certainly check your temperature today too. OK, so anything I missed?

P: Uh, no. I think that that sounds great. Thank you so much.

D: OK, so we'll get the um testing started for uh for the investigations. And yeah, if uh at any point symptoms get worse, we'll reevaluate.

P: Yeah, sounds good. Thank you so much.
