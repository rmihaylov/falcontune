D: OK. OK, uhm, it's just, OK last week, what else, what other symptoms did you have last week?

P: Yeah, I had a sore throat and a little bit of a headache as well, uhm, and, and some aches and fatigue. Those were uh, yeah, that was last week for about three days, and then I started to feel better. But I still have this cough, that, it's still going on.

D: So those other symptoms that you had last week that lasted about three days, are they all gone? are you still feeling fatigued or having a headache?

P: Those are both, yeah, they're gone. 

D: Hmm, It's only the cough?

P: Yeah I just have the cough.

D: Is there any time, any specific time of the day that it's worse or better? Anything that triggers it?

P: Uhm, maybe like, maybe when I went out into the cold or, uhm, like, when I went for a run where I really kind of exerted myself, it brought it on, but other than those things, nothing.

D: OK, but you're otherwise feeling better?

D: Any recreational drugs? 

P: No.

D: OK, alright and any lung conditions that run in the family?

P: No.

D: OK, uhm, OK alright, so that's all that I, I wanted to know. It sounds like you had a, you had a cold last week and you just have this residual cough that's still there, and it's been two weeks and you're just worried about it, but otherwise you're feeling well, you don't have any other symptoms. Often times when we get sick, or we have an infection or inflammation of the, uhm, the airway, we can get a cough that lasts a long time and it might just take you a couple more weeks for the cough to go away. But if you feel that it's getting any worse or you're, you have those symptoms come back again, or you develop a fever, we can, you can definitely, we can do something more about that. I'll also do a physical exam and, and see how you're doing and then we can go from there.

P: OK, great, thank you.
